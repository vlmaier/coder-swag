# Coder Swag

It's a demo app project which was created during the Udemy course [Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/devslopes-android-kotlin/).
The app itself is an online shop catalog mockup application. During the course and the development of this application I was able to learn about `ConstraintLayout` and `ListView`.
