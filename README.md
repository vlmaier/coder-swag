**Coder Swag** is a demo application which was created during the Udemy
course [Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/devslopes-android-kotlin/)
.
**Coder Swag**  is an online shop catalog mockup application. During the course and development
of **Coder Swag**  I was able to learn about `ConstraintLayout` and `ListView`.
